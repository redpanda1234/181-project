        annotate = {In this paper, the authors examine generalizations
                  of abstract Turing machines to the case of dynamical
                  systems on symbolic spaces (compact metric spaces
                  whose clopen sets form a countable basis). Since
                  every compact metric space can be realized as the
                  continuous image of the Cantor set, we can think
                  of any symbolic space (up to homeomorphism) as
                  being represented by a closed subset of the Cantor
                  set. As a first example, the authors consider
                  consider a simple dynamical-systems-flavored
                  statement of the halting problem: namely, given an
                  \emph{effective} system $f : X \to X$ and clopen
                  subsets $U,V \subseteq X$, does there exist $x \in U$,
                  $n \in \NN$ such that $f^{(n)}(x) \in V$? Similar
                  formulations are given for other variants of the
                  halting problem, with some discussion of
                  corresponding automata, as well as the concept of
                  decidability. \\\\

                  After these introductury concepts, the authors give
                  the definition of ``computational universality''
                  that they employ in their analysis. In addition to
                  examples from Turing machines, the authors
                  demonstrate how the definition applies to cases such
                  as \emph{cellular automata}, \emph{tag systems}, and
                  \emph{Collatz functions}. They then prove some
                  results linking the computational power of a system
                  to its dynamical properties (e.g., Proposition 6:
                  given an effective system such that for any
                  transition function, the ``observation system''
                  (defined earlier in the paper) has clopen basins,
                  then the system is decidable). Some results relating
                  to shadowing properties and equicontinuity are also
                  proven.

                  Finally, the authors conclude with an example of a
                  chaotic system that is computationally universal
                  (previously thought to be impossible), and discuss
                  how the shadowing property might provide a better
                  heuristic for computational universality.

                  computational universality of piecewise-linear maps
                  is dependent on the dimension of the space. They
                  prove that there exists functions in $PL_2$
                  (piecewise-linear maps from $\RR^2$ to $\RR^2$) that
                  are universal (in the sense that they can simulate
                  an arbitrary Turing machine), but are not capable of
                  simulating arbitrary cellular automata unless the
                  initial configuration is finite. By contrast, they
                  show that $PL_1$ maps are not Turing-complete by
                  employing a result that states 1D PL maps cannot
                  have infinitely-many period-$k$ cycles for
                  infinitely-many $k$. However, they show that if the
                  hypotheses are weakened to allow \emph{countably} PL
                  maps or continuous piecewise-monotone functions,
                  then we do obtain Turing completeness.}

                  between information theory and dynamical systems.
                  Particular attention is payed to the concept of
                  \emph{entropy}, paticularly in the contexts of
                  \emph{strings in a measure space} and the
                  \emph{relative entropy of a measure} (defined by the
                  Kullback-Leibler divergence of an ergodic measure
                  with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure). The
                  authors then prove that certain conditions on the
                  entropy of the measure can be used to obtain bounds
                  on the amount of information required to describe
                  orbits of the dynamical system. To this end, the
                  authors present both theoretical results and
                  ``experimental'' results (computations) for certain
                  dynamical systems, e.g.\ the so-called
                  \emph{Manneville map} $T : [0,1] \to [0,1]$ defined
                  by
                  \[
                    T(x) = \pn{x + x^z} \bmod 1
                  \]

                  \noindent Overall: This paper provides an
                  interesting second perspective on how classical
                  ideas in computing intersect with dynamical systems.
                  In some ways the analysis appears to be more
                  tractable than that appearing in the papers we have
                  read that examine the dynamics of turing machines.
                  However, it is likely that our paper will not
                  emphasize the ideas in this paper as much --- if we
                  employ it, it will probably be primarily for the
                  introduction to information theory in ergodic
                  systems it gives, and less for the actual results
                  proved.
