                  between information theory and dynamical systems.
                  Particular attention is payed to the concept of
                  \emph{entropy}, paticularly in the contexts of
                  \emph{strings in a measure space} and the
                  \emph{relative entropy of a measure} (defined by the
                  Kullback-Leibler divergence of an ergodic measure
                  with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure). The
                  authors then prove that certain conditions on the
                  entropy of the measure can be used to obtain bounds
                  on the amount of information required to describe
                  orbits of the dynamical system. \\\\

                  This paper provides an interesting second
                  perspective on how classical ideas in computing
                  intersect with dynamical systems. In some ways the
                  analysis appears to be more tractable than that
                  appearing in the papers we have read that examine
                  the dynamics of turing machines. However, it is
                  likely that our paper will not emphasize the ideas
                  in this paper as much.
